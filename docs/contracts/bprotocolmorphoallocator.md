# BProtocolMorphoAllocator.sol

## Overview

[BProtocolMorphoAllocator](../../src/morpho/BProtocolMorphoAllocator.sol) is the first contract that leverage the SmartLTV project, designed to manage morpho market allocations while ensuring compliance with risk parameters. It interfaces with SmartLTV for LTV calculations and MetaMorpho Vault for reallocation operations.

## Features

- **Market Allocation Management**: Handles the reallocation of assets across different markets.
- **Risk Assessment**: Integrates risk data checks to ensure safe allocation based on market conditions.

## Immutable Variables

- `SMART_LTV`: Reference to the SmartLTV contract for LTV calculations.
- `METAMORPHO_VAULT`: Address of the MetaMorpho Vault contract for market reallocations.
- `MIN_CLF`: Immutable variable representing the minimum collateralization liquidation factor.

## Constructor

Initializes the contract with references to SmartLTV contract and MetaMorpho Vault.

## Functions

### checkAndReallocate

```solidity
function checkAndReallocate(
    MarketAllocation[] calldata allocations,
    RiskData[] calldata riskDatas,
    Signature[] calldata signatures
) external
```

- **Description**: Checks the risk of each allocation using provided risk data and reallocates assets accordingly.
- **Parameters**:
  - `allocations`: Array of market allocations.
  - `riskDatas`: Array of risk data corresponding to each market allocation.
  - `signatures`: Array of signatures corresponding to each risk data entry.

## Usage

The BProtocolMorphoAllocator contract is used to automate and optimize the allocation of assets in DeFi platforms, ensuring that each allocation complies with the predefined risk parameters and market conditions.
